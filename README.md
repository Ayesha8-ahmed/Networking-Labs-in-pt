# My Cisco Packet Tracer Lab Collection

Hi there! 👋  
This repository is where I’m documenting my journey into networking using **Cisco Packet Tracer**. I’m building and sharing different labs here as I learn — everything from basic setups to more advanced routing and switching concepts.

Each lab comes with a `.pkt` file and a small notes file explaining what I did, how I did it, and what I learned. It’s a way for me to practice, reflect, and track my progress.

## 💡 What This Repo Includes

- Network topologies built using Cisco Packet Tracer
- Configuration for routers, switches, and end devices
- Step-by-step notes for each lab
- Real examples that help make theory more practical

## 🧪 Labs So Far

Some of the things I’ve covered or will be covering soon:

- Setting up IP addresses and testing connectivity
- Creating VLANs and configuring trunk ports
- Routing between VLANs using routers and Layer 3 switches
- Static and dynamic routing protocols (RIP, OSPF, etc.)
- Setting up DHCP, DNS, NAT, and PAT
- Configuring Access Control Lists (ACLs)
- Redundancy with STP and EtherChannel
- WAN basics like PPP and serial links

> More labs will be added as I keep learning!

## 🗂️ How It’s Organized

Each folder contains:

- A `.pkt` file (the actual lab)
- A `lab-notes.md` file where I explain the lab and write down my steps, mistakes, and lessons

## 📌 Why I’m Doing This

This repo is mostly for me — to stay consistent, learn by doing, and make sure I don’t forget what I’ve already learned. But if it helps someone else out there too, even better. 💬

Thanks for checking it out! 🌐
